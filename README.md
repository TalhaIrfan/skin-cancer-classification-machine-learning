# skin-cancer-classification-machine-learning
This repository contains code to train the model for Skin Lesions Classification for benign and malignant classes, trained model and code to use the model.
Sample Output: ![alt text](https://github.com/TalhaIrfan/skin-cancer-classification-machine-learning/blob/main/b1.JPG?raw=true)

# Important Note
 We created a new dataset using the hair removal algorithm(uploaded). Interestingly, this method increased the accuracy of the model from 71% to 86%.
You can run for more epochs and increase the accuracy significantly. I didnt upload the complete dataset, just few imagse to test the model. You can download and create one using the script I shared.

# Using Model
- Open the ModelLoading.py file
- Chagne the image path and run the code
- It'll load the model and predict on the given image
 
# Results
 A few images I used from test set to test the model:
